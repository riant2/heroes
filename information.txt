I just want to share some unknown issues in my experience:

Energy gain when being hit is +10, for critical it is +20, while between 0-100 energy.
After %100 energy, if hero silenced, every hit to enemy means %50 skill damage instead of +50 energy.
After %100 energy, with every incoming normal hit, heroes gain +%10 skill damage, for incoming critical hits, +%20. (No matter they silenced or stunned, they can still gain skill damage)
After %100 energy, if fox use her ability, you'll gain equal amount of skill damage.
Heroes with energy steal ability is working in behind even if seems to you not working with full energy bar, by reducing the skill damage.(After 100 energy)
Skill damage does NOT effects DoTs
Armor break effects DoTs
Dodge cap is %80
Holy damage is additional attack of output damage.
Skill damage is just addition of normal skill percentage, for eg: Aidan 6 star has %84 skill damage, with max guild tech(%40) it will be %124.
Crit damage calculation: attack output * (1,5 + Crit damage * 2).
For eg: You are hitting a hero with 30k. And you have % 30 crit damage. When your crit procs your damage output will be this:
30k * (1,5 + 0,3*2) = 63k
All monster stats are hidden but it all effected by every percentage of bonuses (It does not adding to hero stats directly.)
For eg: Lets assume we have 20k Hp stat from monster. What we got with all %HP bonus:
%11 from illus gears first bonus HP + %6 from illus gears second bonus HP, %20 from hero passive, %10 from basic tech, %20 from advanced tech, %5 from stone, %10 from artifact.
This means total HP from monster is:
20k * 1,11 * 1,06 * 1,2 * 1,1 * 1,2 * 1.05 * 1,1 = 43,05k HP
